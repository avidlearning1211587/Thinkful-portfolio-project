                    <p> I'm a Student at thinkful and I aim to become a software engineer and use my code to help people!</p>
                    <p>At a very young age, I've been into tech fun fact! when I was two years old it was my birthday and I had a blues clues cake for my second birthday any two-year-old would love that not me my dad had a pc and I cried for the pc instead of the cake!
                    and at the age of eight, I got my first ever laptop and played a lot of Roblox and made maps then at the age of fourteen I built my first ever pc it was a Hackintosh, and it was much harder back then to make a Hackintosh!</p>
                    <p>A value I hold close to me is that I need to stop learning anything because in the world of tech it's always moving fast and this is a core value to me using my code to help people is first and not to use coding to do bad things because a man once said "With great power comes great responsibility" and it's a huge responsibility to be a software engineer</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I like to learn more about tech and keep learning new stuff so I'm never done with school! And here are some of my hobbies</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Train my Muay Thai skills </li>
                <li>Go workout and hangout with friends and family</li>
                <li>Watch ufc fights and news</li>
